# Non-Linear Regression Analysis (MTH686 Project)

This repository contains my submission for the **MTH686 Course Project** at IIT Kanpur.  
The project focuses on **Non-Linear Regression Analysis**, applying statistical methods to fit data under different model assumptions, estimate parameters, and validate results.

## 🧩 Project Description
Given a dataset of the form **(t, y(t))**, the task was to analyze it using **non-linear regression models** and perform the following:

1. Estimate parameters using **Least Squares Estimation (LSE)** under three different model assumptions:
   - Exponential model  
   - Rational function model  
   - Polynomial model  

2. Choose appropriate initial guesses for the parameters.  

3. Identify the **best-fitting model** using statistical measures.  

4. Estimate error variance **σ²**.  

5. Compute **confidence intervals** for parameters using the **Fisher Information Matrix**.  

6. Analyze residuals and check for **normality assumption**.  

7. Plot **observed data vs fitted curves** for visualization.
